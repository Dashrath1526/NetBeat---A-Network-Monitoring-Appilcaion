# NetBeat--A-Network-Monitoring-Appilcaion

A easy-to-use network monitoring application designed and developed in C#, WPF and MahApps.Metro UI toolkit.

This application result all the ip-addresses(hosts) connected to same sub network. It will show information like
ip-addess, MAC address and username of all the hosts that are in the same network and live at the current time, it 
will ignore the hosts that are not active. For the application to find the host, the host has to be active on LAN, and 
not necessary for the host to be connected to the internet. 

My future plans for this application: 
  1. Find the data usage of the host if it is connected to the internet.
  2. Current version shows data in grid view, wants to design a graph based statistics for both particular host and entire subnet.
  3. Find the list of URLs that the host has visited on internet.
